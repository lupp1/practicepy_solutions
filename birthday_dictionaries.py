# Birthday dictionaries www.practicepython.org/exercise/2017/01/24/33-birthday-dictionaries.html
# For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, 
# and be able to find that information based on their name. 
# Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. 
# When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them.

# File overlap www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/12/14/23-file-overlap.html
# Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping. 
# One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, 
# and the other .txt file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.
# (If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number. 
# And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia. 
# The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)

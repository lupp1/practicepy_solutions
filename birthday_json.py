# Birthday Json www.practicepython.org/exercise/2017/02/06/34-birthday-json.html
# In the previous exercise we created a dictionary of famous scientistsâ€™ birthdays. 
# In this exercise, modify your program from Part 1 to load the birthday dictionary from a JSON file on disk, 
# rather than having the dictionary defined in the program.

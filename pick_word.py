# This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. 
# The other exercises are: Part 2 and Part 3.
# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. 
# Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. 
# This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. 
# Each line in the file contains a single word.
# Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.
